#Laravel Comment App

This is a simple Laravel app to let see a product then log in to see the comments or make one yourself.

##Install

To run the app, run it locally using Homestead, Valet, or XAMPP.

Copy the .envexample into a .env file. Edit the site location, database, and and mail server settings for an optimized experience. Then run `composer install`. Once done, run `php artisan key:generate`

To get the frontend designs run `npm install` then `npm run dev`

For the database run `php artisan migrate --seed`.

You should be all set to start exploring the app then.
